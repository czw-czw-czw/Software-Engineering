Here is a short English essay on the theme "I like to watch the sunset with my friend":

Watching the Sunset with a Friend

One of my favorite times of day is watching the sunset with my close friend, Emma. There's just something magical about witnessing the sky transform into a breathtaking display of colors as the sun dips below the horizon.

Emma and I try to make a point of getting together a few times a week to catch the sunset. We'll often pack a small picnic and find a nice spot outdoors to sit and take in the view. Maybe it's a hilltop overlooking the city, or a peaceful spot by the lake. Wherever we are, it's the perfect chance for us to unwind after a long day and enjoy each other's company.

As the sun starts to set, the sky slowly morphs from bright blue to vibrant oranges, pinks, and purples. It's mesmerizing to watch the gradual progression of colors, knowing that no two sunsets are exactly alike. Emma and I will sit in comfortable silence, simply soaking in the beautiful scenery around us. 

Occasionally, one of us will point out a particularly striking part of the sunset or make an observation about the clouds. But for the most part, we're content to just be present in the moment, appreciating the tranquility of the experience. There's something so calming about watching the day come to a close with a good friend by your side.

When the sun finally dips below the horizon, casting the world in a warm, golden glow, Emma and I will linger for a few more minutes, reluctant for the moment to end. Then, we'll gather our things and head our separate ways, already looking forward to the next time we can watch the sunset together.
